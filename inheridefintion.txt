Inheritance:
The mechanism of deriving a new class from old class is called inheritance. Getting properties from base class to the derived class is called inheritance. 

* The class which gives properties to the other classes is called base class or super 
class or parent class. The class which accepts or receives properties from the other 
classes is called derived class or sub-class or child class. 
* Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit all the data members and member functions 
of their parent classes. 
* The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability. 
* The “extends” keyword is used in the concept of inheritance. It is used to derive the 
classes from another class.
* The “extends” keyword is used in the sub class declaration and it is followed by 
super class name.
* Subclass inherits all the data members and member functions from the parent class.

Syntax:
class derived-class-name extends base-class-name
{
Variables-declaration;
Member-functions definition;
}

Note:The object must be declared to the derived class only.
